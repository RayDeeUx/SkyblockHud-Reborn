ATTENTION TEXTURE PACK DEVS:
DO NOT CHANGE IMAGE DIMENSIONS OF THE MAPS, OR ELSE THE ANGRY MOB KNOWN AS YOUR TEXTURE PACK USERS WILL COME KNOCKING ON YOUR FRONT DOOR.

Pack Devs please only change the colors on these maps
as changing the size may screw up the player offsets
and I dont want people to complain because their resourcepack changed the
map size. You can change everything else but dont change the size.
